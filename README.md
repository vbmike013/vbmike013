- 👋 Hi, I’m @vbmike013
- 👀 I’m interested in Concepts, Categories, and Cognition
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects investigating people's use and understanding of concepts.
- 📫 How to reach me — I don't know if I should put an email address here.  I'll figue it out later.
